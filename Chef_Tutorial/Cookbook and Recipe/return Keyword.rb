The return keyword can be used to stop processing a recipe based on a condition, 
but continue processing a Chef Infra Client run. For example:

file '/tmp/name_of_file' do
  action :create
end

return if platform?('windows')

package 'name_of_package' do
  action :install
end


where platform?('windows') is the condition set on the return keyword. 
When the condition is met, stop processing the recipe. 
This approach is useful when there is no need to continue processing, such as when a package cannot be installed. 
In this situation, itâ€™s OK for a recipe to stop processing.
